# TotalWebTransactions

This assessment is designed to help show my coding competency, reasoning/analysis capabilities, and communication skills. 

Given the accompanying sample dataset, I am tasked with performing any analysis that I see fit that will help answer the following question: What activities should be performed (i.e. increased/decreased) in order to increase total Web Transactions without negatively impacting the number of Retail Transactions? 

I may note down what I would have liked to do if given more time. 

The main objective is to be able to turn my insights into realistic business actions. It would be beneficial to make appropriate recommendations if/where possible.
